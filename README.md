Performance Optimization of Monolithic Application

Name: B Neeharika
SRN: PES2UG23CS114

Aim:
To identify performance bottlenecks in a monolithic web application and improve response time using load testing.

Tools:
FastAPI, SQLite, Python, Locust, Uvicorn

Optimization Result: 
Faster response and lower CPU usage & Reduced response time and improved throughput

Load Testing:
Locust was used to compare performance before and after optimization (SS6–SS9).

Conclusion:
Removing unnecessary computations significantly improved application performance and scalability.
